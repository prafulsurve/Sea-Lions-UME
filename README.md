# Sea-Lions-UME
Visualizing Causes and Effects Sea Lion's UME

Causes and Effects visualizes California sea lion unusual mortality events (UME) to create a new layer of understanding of the situation as an important environmental issue. It examines the causes of and impacts on sea lion UME by controlling multivariate factors that impact sea lions’ health and stranding. The resulting images of the visualization are not only visually appealing but also allow users to explore how environmental factors impact the lives and situations of sea lions. The visualization using connected circles addresses important issues related the nature’s never-ending cycles and infinite continuations in many aspects.
